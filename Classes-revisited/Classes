Classes in python combines the data and functionality
- Class is like a blue print which can be used to create objects
- Creating new class creates a new type of objects, allowing new instances of that type to be made.
- Each class instance can have attributes to it for maintaining the state.

Instance variables:
- Unique to each instance for example self.first, self.last etc..

Class variables:
- Variables that are shared among all the instances, where as the instance variables can be unique to each instance.
- Annual raise to all employee can be the class variable.
- Class variables are always accessed in class or instance of the class. If not we get error saying not defined.
